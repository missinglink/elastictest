A simple test harness for elasticsearch functional testing

### Install

```bash
npm install elastictest --save
```

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/elastictest.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/elastictest/)

### Example Script

```javascript
var suite = new elastictest.Suite();

var doc = {
  index: suite.props.index,
  id: '1',
  body: {
    foo: 'bar'
  }
};

suite.action( function( done ){
  suite.client.index( doc, done );
});

suite.assert( function( done ){
  suite.client.count({
    index: doc.index,
  }, function( err, res ){
    t.equal( res.count, 1, 'record count' );
    done();
  });
});

suite.run();
```

### Usage

#### Create a new test suite

```javascript
var suite = new elastictest.Suite();
```

#### Perform an 'action' on the database before running assertions

`suite.client` is an instance of the elasticsearch javascript client, so you can do anything that is [supported by that API](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/api-reference.html).

You **must** call `done()` when your async operations are complete. You may add as many `suite.action` sections as you wish per suite.

**note** the test suite will handle refreshing your index so that the data is up-to-date before the assert operations are run.

```javascript
suite.action( function( done ){
  suite.client.index( {}, done );
});
```

#### Run an 'assert' on the database to test if the actions were successful

`suite.assert` allows you to run assertion code against the responses from `suite.client` calls to the database. You can use whatever assertion library you wish as long as it handles the exception catching. In the example below I am using `t.equals` from `npm tape`. A full example can be found in `./test`.

You **must** call `done()` when your async operations are complete. You may add as many `suite.assert` sections as you wish per suite.

```javascript
suite.assert( function( done ){
  suite.client.count({
    index: doc.index,
  }, function( err, res ){
    t.equal( res.count, 1, 'record count' );
    done();
  });
});
```

#### Run the suite

You may provide an `optional_callback` function to run once the suite is complete. This is useful for alerting your testing framework that work is done for this unit of work.

```javascript
suite.run( optional_callback );
```

#### Use a custom schema when creating your test index

You may provide a `schema` property when creating your Suite, this will be used whenever creating new indeces.

```javascript
var suite = new elastictest.Suite( null, { schema: custom_schema });
```
